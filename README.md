# Emergency-Contact-Details

This repository contains the source code for a React.js website designed to provide emergency contact information via a QR code placed behind a helmet. When the QR code is scanned, it allows the user to:

-Call emergency contacts directly by tapping the phone number, which auto-redirects to the phone dialer app.
-View the office address of the helmet owner.

Features
-Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices.
-QR Code Integration: Scanning the QR code provides instant access to emergency contacts and office address.
-Auto-Redirect to Dialer: Tapping the phone number automatically opens the phone dialer app with the number pre-filled.

Technologies Used
-React.js: For building the user interface.
-CSS: For responsive design and styling.
